/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} that is responsive to the {@link CancellableTask}.
 * <p>
 * Many blocking library methods respond to interruption by returning early and throwing InterruptedException,
 * which makes it easier to build tasks that are responsive to cancellation. However, not all blocking methods
 * or blocking mechanisms are responsive to interruption; if a thread is blocked performing synchronous socket
 * I/O or waiting to acquire an intrinsic lock, interruption has no effect other than setting the threadâ€™s
 * interrupted status. We can sometimes convince threads blocked in noninterruptible activities to stop by means
 * similar to interruption, but this requires greater awareness of why the thread is blocked.
 *
 * <p><b>Usage Example</b></p>
 * <pre> {@code
 * class Main {
 *     public static void main(String args[]) {
 *         final Socket socket = ...;
 *
 *         final ExecutorService executor = new CancellableThreadPoolExecutor(1, 1,

 *                             executor.submitCancellable(new SocketReader(socket));
 *         executor.shutdown();
 *
 *         String result = "";
 *         final long timeout = ...;
 *         final TimeUnit unit = ...;
 *         try {
 *             result = cancellableFuture.get(timeout, unit);
 *         } catch (InterruptedException e) {
 *             // Interrupted while waiting
 *         } catch (ExecutionException e) {

 *             );
 *             // it's also possible to cancel the task as a Future#cancel(boolean),
 *             // but in this case it's impossible to define a cancellation reason.
 *         }
 *     }
 * }

 * <p><b>Extension notes:</b> This class overrides the {@link ThreadPoolExecutor#execute(Runnable) execute},
 * {@link ThreadPoolExecutor#newTaskFor(Callable) newTaskFor(Callable)} and
 * {@link ThreadPoolExecutor#newTaskFor(Runnable, Object) newTaskFor(Runnable, defaultValue)}
 * methods to generate internal {@link CancellableFutureTask} objects to control per-task custom cancellation,
 * if an entered task is a {@link CancellableTask}. To preserve functionality, any further overrides of these
 * methods in subclasses are forbidden. However, this class provides alternative protected extension methods
 * {@code #decorateNewTaskFor(Runnable, RunnableFuture)} and {@code #decorateNewTaskFor(Callable, RunnableFuture)}
 * that can be used to customize the concrete task types used to execute commands entered via {@code #execute}
 * and {@code submit}. By default, a {@code CancellableThreadPoolExecutor} uses a task type
 * {@link CancellableFutureTask} for entered {@link CancellableTask}. However, this may be modified or replaced
 * using subclasses of the form:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * public class CustomCancellableExecutor extends CancellableThreadPoolExecutor {
 *
 *   static class CustomTask<V> implements RunnableFuture<V> { ... }
 *
 *   protected <V> RunnableFuture<V> decorateNewTaskFor(Callable<V> callable,
 *                                                      RunnableFuture<V> task) {
